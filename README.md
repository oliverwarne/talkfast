# Talkfast 
###### Yeah, I know it's a dumb name. I'll change it.

This is the repo for my toy encryption project, Talkfast. Basically trying to figure out to communicate securely over a network. 


This repo houses two peices of software. The client and the server. Client is 10% of the way there, server is 0%.
